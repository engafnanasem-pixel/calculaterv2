# The Fun Calculator 🧮🎉

A simple Python calculator that performs basic mathematical operations using two numbers:

- ➕ Addition  
- ➖ Subtraction  
- ✖ Multiply  
- ➗ Division  

✨ The program can save up to **five previous results** and display them when the user types `history`.

## How It Works ⚙️

- The program asks the user to choose an operation.
- If a mathematical operation is selected, the program asks for two numbers.
- The user can type:
  - `history` → to display the last five calculations  
  - `exit` → to close the program
